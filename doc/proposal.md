## **Website Development Proposal for Virtual Dental Service**
### _Project Vision Statement:_
Our web solution for dental services, Virtual Dental Services, is an interactive platform where a dental services center
can promote its business, collect customer information, and provide service financing estimates. This will keep the 
dental services center proactive to gain solid mind share and sustain profitability while gathering constructive inputs 
for its business strategies.

#### _Problem Definition:_
Number of dental service centers do not have a professional website yet other than their current social media platforms. 
These centers are in a need of a well-designed website in which it can continuously communicate with their potential 
customers and their employees. Instead of having a web service only tailored towards the customer side of a dentist's
operations, Virtual Dental Services will provide a framework for employees to properly communicate with their workplace.
The website is needed to be interactive, equipped with necessary business features, and meet quality expectations.
##### _Solution Presentation:_
In order to provide a compiled solution to the identified problem and other business needs of the dental service centers,
a web development team known as FunnyGroupName is dedicated to preparing this proposal. FunnyGroupName will provide a 
web solution with a number of pages where the dental service centers can inform its customers about their business. It 
will be capable of collecting information from customers. It will also enable customers to preview service charges and 
other related financing options.
Also, those dentists do not want to deal with the backend of maintaining the information regarding their customers.
Virtual Dental Services will provide easy access to a MongoDB database to store the information
a dentist needs. This database will allow a dental office to store information about their customers, when appointments
for said customers are, customers service history and information regarding those services. The database will also provide
a way to store information about a company's employees, including contact info, hours worked and when they can work. 
By easily seeing who is working when, what they specialize in, and what customers are in need of, our web solution 
will provide dental services an easier way to organize and more efficiently
plan out their operations
This database, having stored historical data on the dental operations that have been performed, can 
create real-time statistics on how the dental service is currently doing and how it could perhaps perform better.
